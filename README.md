# Labs

The here published labs offer current tasks for the lecture.
They are intended to be solved alongside the lecture in addition to the voluntary assignment sheet.

We don't plan to publish any solutions to the tasks since most tasks are tested inline for correctness so you can test yourself.

If you have questions regarding an exercise, you can raise your question on the forum or open a ticket in this GitLab.

### How to run?

We recommend using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), it provides you with a Jupyter Notebook environment and a copy of this repository. You don't have to install anything.

Another way of running the labs is using the Dockerfile we provide in the repository to build a container similar to the Binder environment.\
Make sure you have Docker installed and system privileges to run a container on your system.

As last resort, we also provide a script to install all dependencies that you need to run the labs. Before you run this script please check if this script is suitable to your system and if not make changes to it. As you should always do with scripts that you didn't write yourself!!!
